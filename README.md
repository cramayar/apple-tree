# APPLE TREE GAME

## About the game
Minimalistic implementation of a popular word guessing game formerly known as
*hangman* but the premise of the game seems unsensitive for most educators and
might send the wrong message to the children.

The rules are the same but in Apple tree we lose an apple every time the player
input the wrong letter.

I wrote this game mostly to provide educational tools for my kids and I want now
to share it with you.

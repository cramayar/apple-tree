## About the game
Minimalistic implementation of a popular word guessing game formerly known as
*hangman* but the premise of the game does not withstand the test of time, and
seems not only unnecesary but also insensitive for most educators and children.

## How to play

In the console run:
```
python3 apple_tree.py
```

The player needs to input a letter from the alphabet and then press **Enter**.
If the letter is in the word, the user will be prompted with to insert a new letter.
If the inserted letter is not in the word in an apple will be disappear from the tree.

The game ends if the player guessed all the letters or if the tree runs out of apples.

I wrote this game mostly to provide educational tools for my kids and I want now
to share it with you.
